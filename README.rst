.. tip::
    Note that the package name on PyPI is `python-networkdays`, but you import it as `networkdays`.

Practical Examples
==================

Calculate business days between two dates
-----------------------------------------

Just like in your favorite spreadsheet, calculate the working days, disregarding weekends and holidays.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import date
    from networkdays import Networkdays

    # Define the holidays
    HOLIDAYS = {date(2024, 12, 25), date(2025, 1, 1)}

    # Create a Networkdays instance
    workdays = Networkdays(
        date(2024, 12, 20),  # Start date
        date(2025, 1, 10),   # End date
        HOLIDAYS             # List of holidays
    )

    # Get the list of workdays
    day_list = workdays.networkdays()
    print(f"There are {len(day_list)} working days.")
    # There are 14 working days.

    # You can also list the weekends and holidays in the period
    print(f"Holidays: {workdays.holidays()}")
    # Holidays: [datetime.date(2024, 12, 25), datetime.date(2025, 1, 1)]

    print(f"Weekends: {workdays.weekends()}")
    # Weekends: [datetime.date(2024, 12, 21), datetime.date(2024, 12, 22), ... ]


Plan your Project
-------------------

Estimate the end date of a project based on working hours.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import date
    from networkdays import JobSchedule

    # Plan a 120-hour project, with 8 working hours per day,
    # starting on July 1, 2024.
    schedule = JobSchedule(
        project_duration_hours=120,
        workhours_per_day=8,
        date_start=date(2024, 7, 1)
    )

    print(f"The project will take {schedule.bussines_days} business days.")
    # The project will take 15 business days.

    print(f"Starts on: {schedule.prj_starts}")
    # Starts on: 07/01/24

    print(f"Ends on: {schedule.prj_ends}")
    # Ends on: 07/19/24

    # Analyze the work distribution
    print(f"Project years: {list(schedule.years())}")
    # Project years: [2024]

    print(f"Project months: {list(schedule.months())}")
    # Project months: [7]


Total Flexibility
-------------------

Work on Saturdays? No problem. `networkdays` adapts to your needs.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import date
    from networkdays import Networkdays

    # Consider only Sunday as a day off (1=Mon, 7=Sun)
    saturday_workdays = Networkdays(
        date(2024, 7, 1),
        date(2024, 7, 31),
        weekdaysoff={7}  # Only Sundays
    )

    print(f"Working days in July (working on Saturdays): {len(saturday_workdays.networkdays())}")
    # Working days in July (working on Saturdays): 27
